# FlaPYball [UNDER CONSTRUCTION]

![This is supposed to be the alternative text](/screenshot/screenshot.png)

Once upon a time, in a village far far away, there lived a bird they called Flappy. Flappy was a cheerful chap. Strolling admist the industrialized concrete jungle of modern human civilization, Flappy found himself tackling complex pipe formations and having to maneuver his way through the mess proved to be a herculian task for the little bird. Once out of the horse shit, Flappy came across highly energized homo sapiens kicking the living crap out of an inflated rubber ball manufactured for the sole intent of doing the same. They seemed to be trying really hard to somehow kick the ball into a fishing net. Flappy was intrigued. After returning home, he spreads this culture among his brethren. They loved it and Flappy became the king of his people. This was counted among the top 10 anime plot twists of the decade. 
Now you know.

A few things to remember:
* All collisions are elastic.
* Mass of the ball and bird are equal, so velocities exchange.
* This game is pretty buggy as of now.
* Don't forget to play with the physics.
